wxPython-ePub-Reader
====================

This program was written as a simple and easy to use ePub reader
for the Windows operating system. The goal is to create an executable
that uses wxPython.

After trying multiple ebook packages I decided to make my own ePub reader from scratch. "Why start from scratch instead of using an existing package or library?" To put it simply, the libraries and packages available have no issues with some of my epubs while others load incorrectly if at all. I am working on creating something that is capable of opening any of my personal epub files so that I can read them on any of my computers. The main focus right now is reading ePubs that do not completely follow the ePub 2 or ePub 3 formats, while ensuring future GUI features can be added more easily.

Information regarding ePub files can either be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB, or with an internet search.


The README, and code will be further updated when time is available.
